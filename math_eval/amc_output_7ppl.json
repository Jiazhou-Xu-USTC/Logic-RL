We need to divide by the number of ways to arrange 7 pairs, which is 7!

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, identify the favorable outcomes for each condition:\n- Numbers greater than 4 are 5 and 6. So, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 for each die.\n- Numbers greater than 2 are 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 4 favorable outcomes out of 6 for each die.\n\nWe need to find the probability of the intersection of these two events: at least one number is greater than 4 and at least two numbers are greater than 2.\n\nLet's use complementary counting to find the probability of the complementary event, which is the event that either fewer than two numbers are greater than 2 or no numbers are greater than 4.\n\n1. Calculate the probability that fewer than two numbers are greater than 2:\n   - No numbers greater than 2: Each die shows 1, 2, or 2 (3 choices out of 6). The probability is \\((\\frac{3}{6})^4 = (\\frac{1}{2})^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\\).\n   - Exactly one number greater than 2: Choose 1 die to show a number greater than 2 (4 choices) and the other 3 dice to show 1 or 2. The probability is \\(4 \\times (\\frac{4}{6}) \\times (\\frac{3}{6})^3 = 4 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{27}{216} = 4 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n   So, the probability that fewer than two numbers are greater than 2 is \\(\\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{48} + \\frac{16}{48} = \\frac{19}{48}\\).\n\n2. Calculate the probability that no numbers are greater than 4:\n   - Each die shows 1, 2, 3, or 4 (4 choices out of 6). The probability is \\((\\frac{4}{6})^4 = (\\frac{2}{3})^4 = \\frac{16}{81}\\).\n\n3. Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the probability of the intersection of these two complementary events:\n   - The probability that fewer than two numbers are greater than 2 and no numbers are greater than 4 is the product of the two probabilities since they are independent events: \\(\\frac{19}{48} \\times \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{304}{3888}\\).\n\nThe probability of the desired event is 1 minus the probability of the complementary event:\n\\[1 - \\left(\\frac{19}{48} + \\frac{16}{81} - \\frac{304}{3888}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{19 \\times 81 + 16 \\times 48 - 304}{3888}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1551 + 768 - 304}{3888}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2015}{3888}\\right) = \\frac{1873}{3888}.\\]\n\nThe denominator of the probability is 3888 and the numerator is 1873. The problem asks for the denominator minus the numerator:\n\\[3888 - 1873 = 2015.\\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{2015}\\). </think>\n<answer> 2015 </answer>",

The rectangle has side lengths of 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. Three vertices of the square lie on three different sides of the rectangle, meaning one side of the square is completely inside the rectangle.\n\nSince the side length of the square is 5, and the rectangle's shorter side is 4, the square cannot be completely inside the rectangle along its full length because 5 is greater than 4. Therefore, the square must be oriented such that one of its sides is along the 8-unit side of the rectangle, and the other two vertices of the square touch the other two sides of the rectangle.\n\nLet's assume the square is positioned such that one of its 5-unit sides is along the 8-unit side of the rectangle.

Let's denote the row sums by \\(r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\) and the column sums by \\(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\).\n\nFirst, note that the sum of all row sums must equal the sum of all column sums, which is the total number of 1's in the matrix. Since there are 4 rows and each row sum is one of 1, 2, 3, or 4, the total number of 1's must be \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\). This means the matrix must have exactly 10 ones.\n\nWe need to consider the possible distributions of row and column sums. The only way to achieve row sums of 1, 2, 3, and 4 is to have one row with 4 ones, one row with 3 ones, one row with 2 ones, and one row with 1 one. Similarly, the column sums must also be 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nLet's place the row with 4 ones. There is only one way to do this, and it can be in any of the 4 positions. Once this row is placed, we need to place the row with 3 ones, which can be in any of the remaining 3 positions. The row with 2 ones can be in any of the remaining 2 positions, and the row with 1 one will be in the last position. This gives us \\(4! = 24\\) ways to arrange the rows.\n\nNow, let's consider the columns. The column with 1 one must be in the same position as the row with 1 one. The column with 2 ones must be in two of the positions of the row with 2 ones. The column with 3 ones must be in three of the positions of the row with 3 ones. The column with 4 ones is already determined by the row with 4 ones. This means we need to count the number of ways to assign the remaining 6 ones to the columns, which is the same as the number of ways to permute the remaining 6 ones among the 3 columns with 2, 3, and 4 ones, respectively.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is the number of ways to partition 6 ones into 3 groups of sizes 2, 3, and 1, which is given by the multinomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \\frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60\\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of such matrices is \\(4! \\times \\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = 24 \\times 60 = 1440\\).\n\nFinally, we need to find the remainder when 1440 is divided by 100, which is \\(1440 \\mod 100 = 40\\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{40}\\). </think>\n<answer> \\boxed{40} </answer>",

        "generated_output": "<think> To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular icosahedron and the distances between its vertices. A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle.\n\nFirst, let's determine the possible distances between any two vertices of the icosahedron:\n- The distance \\(d(A, B) = 1\\) if vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are directly connected by an edge.\n- The distance \\(d(A, B) = 2\\) if there is no direct edge between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), but they are connected by a path of two edges.\n- The distance \\(d(A, B) = 3\\) if there is no direct or two-edge path between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), but they are connected by a path of three edges.\n\nWe need to find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) for randomly chosen vertices \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\).\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the symmetry and the distances between vertices in a regular icosahedron. The icosahedron can be divided into two sets of vertices such that the distance between any two vertices in the same set is 2, and the distance between any two vertices in different sets is 3.\n\nLet's label the vertices of the icosahedron such that we can use the symmetry of the structure. We can assume that the icosahedron is symmetric, and the vertices can be divided into two sets of 6 vertices each, such that any two vertices in the same set are at a distance of 2, and any two vertices in different sets are at a distance of 3.\n\nGiven this symmetry, we can calculate the probability as follows:\n- The probability that \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\) is the probability that \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are directly connected by an edge. This happens with probability \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\) because each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices.\n- The probability that \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) is the probability that \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are not directly connected, but are connected by a path of two edges. This happens with probability \\(\\frac{6}{11}\\).\n- The probability that \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\) is the probability that \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are not directly connected, and not connected by a path of two edges. This happens with probability \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\).\n\nSince the icosahedron is symmetric, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability that \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\). Therefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).

        "question": "Points $A$ and $B$ lie on the graph of $y=\\log_{2}x$. The midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is $(6, 2)$. What is the positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$? The final answer can be written in the form $m \\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
        "generated_output": "<think> To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of logarithms and the midpoint formula. Let's denote the coordinates of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) respectively. Since both points lie on the graph of \\(y = \\log_2 x\\), we have \\(y_1 = \\log_2 x_1\\) and \\(y_2 = \\log_2 x_2\\).\n\nThe midpoint of \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is given as \\((6, 2)\\). Using the midpoint formula, we can write:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right) = (6, 2)\n\\]\nThis gives us two equations:\n\\[\n\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = 2\n\\]\nFrom the first equation, we get:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 = 12\n\\]\nFrom the second equation, we get:\n\\[\ny_1 + y_2 = 4\n\\]\nSince \\(y_1 = \\log_2 x_1\\) and \\(y_2 = \\log_2 x_2\\), we substitute these into the equation \\(y_1 + y_2 = 4\\):\n\\[\n\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2 = 4\n\\]\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the logs:\n\\[\n\\log_2 (x_1 x_2) = 4\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\nx_1 x_2 = 2^4 = 16\n\\]\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 = 12\n\\]\n\\[\nx_1 x_2 = 16\n\\]\nWe can solve this system by treating it as a quadratic equation. Let \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) be the roots of the quadratic equation \\(t^2 - (x_1 + x_2)t + x_1 x_2 = 0\\).

For example, Arbor Day this year is displayed as 20230428. For how many dates in $2023$ will each digit appear an even number of times in the 8-digital display for that date?",
        "generated_output": "<think> To solve this problem, we need to find how many dates in 2023 have an 8-digit display where each digit appears an even number of times. The date is formatted as 2023MMDD, where MM is the month and DD is the day.\n\nFirst, let's list the digits that appear in the date format: 2, 0, 2, 3, M, M, D, D. We need to ensure that each digit (including the month and day digits) appears an even number of times.\n\nThe year part (2023) contributes the digits 2, 0, 2, 3. The digit 2 appears twice, the digit 0 appears once, the digit 3 appears once, and the digit 1 does not appear. So, we need the month and day to compensate for the odd counts of 0 and 3, and to maintain the even count for 2 and 3.\n\nLet's analyze the months and days:\n- Months range from 01 to 12, contributing digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n- Days range from 01 to 31, contributing digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nWe need to find combinations of MM and DD such that the total count of each digit is even.\n\nLet's start with the month:\n- If MM is 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, the digit 0 appears once, which is odd. So, MM cannot be any of these.\n- If MM is 10, 11, 12, the digit 1 appears twice, which is even. So, MM can be 10, 11, or 12.\n\nNow, let's check the days for each valid month:\n- For MM = 10, the day DD can be 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. We need to count how many of these days have an even number of each digit.\n- For MM = 11, the day DD can be 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. We need to count how many of these days have an even number of each digit.\n- For MM = 12, the day DD can be 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.

By detailed checking, we find that there are 15 valid days for each month.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid dates is \\(3 \\times 15 = 45\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{45}\\). </think>\n<answer> \\(\\boxed{45}\\) </answer>",
